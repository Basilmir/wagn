See http://wagn.org/wagn/Installation for the latest version of these instructions.

YOU WILL NEED

A RubyonRails environment, including either Postgres or Mysql (SQLite support coming soon). If you don't have a preferred Rails environment, try InstantRails, and then see the Installation+instant rails.

    NOTE: Things are working well in Rails 2.1.2; so far there are some problems with Rails 2.2.

You will also need to install some gems: json_pure, ruby-openid, and cached_model.

    sudo gem install json_pure
    sudo gem install ruby-openid
    sudo gem install cached_model


GET THE CODE

To get the latest code, you will need to use git:

    git clone git://github.com/wagn/wagn.git
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

    NOTE: We have switched all new development to git - maintaining the sync with svn proved too much maintenance.  You can still download Wagn from RubyForge.org, but we will only be posting major releases there.  The last release posted was Wagn 0.10+1.

 
CONFIGURE WAGN

   1. In the config directory, copy sample_wagn.rb to wagn.rb
   2. In wagn.rb set:
      System.base_url= final URL (what users will really type in their browser)
      System.site_title=name of the Wagn's front page (note: this can be overridden in Wagn itself).
   3. to get mail working, see Installation+mail setup

 
CONFIGURE YOUR DATABASE

   1. In the config directory, copy sample_database.yml to database.yml
   2. In database.yml set
      adapter: ( mysql or postgresql )
      user: ( your db user. root often works for default mysql installs )
   3. If you're running a public wagn, change the session_key and secret fields
   4. Create the database: rake db:create
   5. set up the database: rake db:migrate   

If you have trouble with step 3 or 4 check out Installation+database details

 
START IT UP

   1. Start the server: ./script/server
   2. Point your browser to http://localhost:3000 (or your System.base_url above).

 
CONFIGURE YOUR WAGN


Now that your Wagn is running, read configuration to set up its home page, logos, security, etc.

 
PRODUCTION


To run Wagn in production, you need to compile your js and css assets. this is done as follows:

rake RAILS_ENV=production asset:packager:build_all
