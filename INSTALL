See http://wagn.org/wagn/Installation for the latest version of these instructions.


OPTION A: QUICK START
(recommended for trial)
 
  You will need: ruby (1.8.6+) and either Postgres or Mysql, and the appropriate ruby gems for your database.
  
    1. Download the latest stable release from RubyForge: http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3630
    2. untar or unzip the package
    3. configure config/database.yml for your database. (defaults work with default mysql install)
    4. run rake wagn:create
    5. run ./script/server

 
 
OPTION B: INSTALL VIA GIT
(recommended for active sites)
 
  We recommend installing via git for sites in active use in order to get access to the most recent code and to make upgrades easier.
  You will need: git, Rails 2.3.5 and either Postgres or Mysql and the appropriate gems for your database.
  
    1. Get the source
          git clone git://github.com/wagn/wagn.git 
          cd wagn; git submodule update --init
    2. In the config directory:
          copy sample_database.yml to database.yml
          copy sample_wagn.rb to wagn.rb
    3. configure config/database.yml for your database.
    4. run rake gems:install (See note about rspec below)
    5. run rake wagn:create
    6. run ./script/server
    
  As of Wagn v 1.x it is required to gem install rspec (rspec was moved from vendor to gem)
 
 
 
SERVER TWEAKS / PROBLEM SOLVING
   
  ~ Trouble?
  If you're having trouble with your database setup see http://wagn.org/Installation+database 
   
  ~ Running on a different port or url
  Wagn by default assumes you'll be running it at http://localhost:3000
  If this isn't the case, edit config/wagn.rb and set System.base_url = http://yoursite:yourport
   
  ~ Mail
  see http://wagn.org/Installation+mail setup
   
  ~ Security
  If your wagn will be publicly accessible you should change the session_key and secret fields in config/database.yml
   
  ~ Production
  Before running Wagn in production, you need to compile your js and css assets by running
  rake RAILS_ENV=production asset:packager:build_all
   
  ~ Site Customization
  Most of Wagn's settings can be set through the web interface. Follow sidebar links to set up your home page, logos, security, etc.
