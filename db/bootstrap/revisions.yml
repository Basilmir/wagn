    <hr>
    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <p><em>If instead you want people to be able to sign up for an account, but require approval from yourself or another Administrator, then change the [[/card/options/Account Requests|options on Account Requests]] to allow "Anyone" to create Account Requests. (A "Sign Up" link will appear<span> at the top right of every page for people who are not already signed in.) Their requests will be emailed to this address for approval:</span></em></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em><span>People whose requests are approved will receive an invite email as above.</span></em></p>

    <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;--[[John Abbe]].....Mon Mar 02 08:10:02 -0800 2009</em></p>
    <hr>
    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <h2>Creating an Open-edit Wagn<br></h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>To create an Open-edit Wagn, change the permissions in the Options tab of [[Basic+*tform]] so that it is editable and creatable by "Anyone". Do the same for any other [[Cardtypes]] you want people to be able to edit and create without being signed in (i.e. [[Date+*tform]], etc.). It's best to do this right when you create your Wagn, because on the cards that you want to be openly editable that exist before you do this, you will have to change the Options one by one. Note: Make sure <strong>not</strong> to give edit permissions to Anyone for HTML, Ruby or Script cards, as this could present a security risk.</em></p>

    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <p>[[*instances+*rform]] is in default, last-edited order. Sort alpha?</p>
    <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;--[[John Abbe]].....Mon Mar 02 08:10:02 -0800 2009</em></p>
    <hr>
    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;--[[John Abbe]].....Mon Mar 02 08:10:02 -0800 2009</em></p>
    <hr>
    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <p><strong>Welcome to your new Wagn!</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To name your Wagn, put in your own logo, and decide how you'll add new people to the system, go to [[Config]] and fill things out at least through the Account Basics.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Also, make sure to look through [[http://wagn.org/wagn/configuration|Wagn Configuration]], especially the section on security.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <p><em><strong></strong></em><strong>[[*favicon]]</strong></p>
    <p><strong>check on star-cards for putting new role/user/card-editing on Related tab</strong></p>
    <p><strong>delete [[Setting]], [[Currency]], [[Percentage]]</strong> - waiting on http://wagn.org/wagn/Can_t_remove_or_change_Cardtype_of_Cardtype_cards</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>On <strong>[[Config]]:</strong></em></p>
    <p>links (some via labels) to documentation</p>
    <p><strong>[[*request+*to]]</strong> - are we ok with the default info@grasscommons.org?</p>
    <p><strong>[[Signup Success]], [[Invite Success]]</strong> - fuller explanation</p>
    <p><strong>*from+*rform</strong> (Phrase) or just default content for *invite+ and *signup+</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>[[*logo]] - make sure re licensing</p>

    <h1>Inquiries<br></h1>
    <p>make [[*type cards+*rform]] sort alpha?</p>
    <p>Do we want to include some wagn.org/documentation? (including it all waits for Wagn-hitching, something like cross-Wagn inclusion.) Maybe some +*edit stuff... <strong>scan</strong> http://wagn.org/wagn/cards_to_include_by_default</p>

It's best to do this right when you create your Wagn, because on the cards that you want to be openly editable that exist before you do this, you will have to change the Options one by one. Note: Make sure <strong>not</strong> to give edit permissions to Anyone for HTML, Ruby or Script cards, as this could present a security risk.</em></p>

    <p>[[*type cards+*rform]] is in default, last-edited order. Sort alpha?</p>
    <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;--[[John Abbe]].....Mon Mar 02 08:10:02 -0800 2009</em></p>
    <hr>
    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <h2>Ongoing work<br></h2>
    <p>Update http://wagn.org/wagn/star_cards</p>
    <p>When documenting tickets that relate to [[http://wagn.org/wagn/Installation+tickets_for_item|installation]] or [[http://wagn.org/wagn/administration+tickets_for_item|administration]], make sure to update [[Config]].</p>
    <p>Take a look at http://wagn.org/wagn/cards_to_include_by_default once in a while</p>

    <p>[[*instances+*rform]] is in default, last-edited order. Sort alpha?</p>
    <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;--[[John Abbe]].....Mon Mar 02 08:10:02 -0800 2009</em></p>
    <hr>
    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <h2>Creating an Open-edit Wagn<br></h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>To create an Open-edit Wagn, change the permissions in the Options tab of [[Basic+*tform]] so that it is editable and creatable by "Anyone". Do the same for any other [[Cardtypes]] you want people to be able to edit and create without being signed in (i.e. [[Date+*tform]], etc.). It's best to do this right when you create your Wagn, because on the cards that you want to be openly editable that exist before you do this, you will have to change the Options one by one. Note: Make sure <strong>not</strong> to give edit permissions to Anyone for HTML, Ruby or Script cards, as this could present a security risk.</em></p>

    <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;--[[John Abbe]].....Mon Mar 02 08:10:02 -0800 2009</em></p>
    <hr>
    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:<br></p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;--[[John Abbe]].....Mon Mar 02 08:10:02 -0800 2009</em></p>
    <hr>
    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Mediated Sign-up</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>If instead you want people to be able to sign up for an account, but require approval from yourself or another Administrator, then change the [[/card/options/Account Requests|options on Account Requests]] to allow "Anyone" to create Account Requests.

    <h2>Unmediated Sign-up<br></h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>A third alternative is for people to be able to sign up for an account without requiring any approval. To enable this, change the [[/card/options/Account Requests|options on Account Requests]] to allow "Anyone" to create Account Requests, and, allow "Anyone" to create accounts (on [[/admin/tasks|Global Permissions]]).</em><em> (A "Sign Up" link will appear<span> at the top right of every page for people who are not signed in.) </span></em><em> People who sign up will almost immediately receive an email, with their new password at the end.

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>After Signing Up<br></h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>What people see after signing up should be substantially different depending on whether or not they must wait for approval. You can edit the message here:</em></p>

For examples see [[http://wagn.org/wagn/custom_sign-up_information|custom sign-up information]].

    <h2>Creating an Open Edit Wagn<br></h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>To create an open edit Wagn, change the permissions in the Options tab of [[Basic+*tform]] so that it is editable and creatable by "Anyone". Do the same for any other [[Cardtypes]] you want people to be able to edit and create without being signed in (i.e. [[Date+*tform]], etc.). It's best to do this right when you create your Wagn, because on the cards that you want to be openly editable that exist before you do this, you will have to change the Options one by one. Note: Make sure <strong>not</strong> to give edit permissions to Anyone for HTML, Ruby or Script cards, as this could present a security risk.</em></p>

    <p>[[*type cards+*rform]] is in default, last-edited order. Sort alpha?</p>
    <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;--[[John Abbe]].....Mon Mar 02 08:10:02 -0800 2009</em></p>
    <hr>
    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

Do the same for any other [[Cardtypes]] you want people to be able to edit and create without being signed in (i.e. [[Date+*tform]], etc.). It's best to do this right when you create your Wagn, because on the cards that you want to be openly editable that exist before you do this, you will have to change the Options one by one. Note: Make sure <strong>not</strong> to give edit permissions to Anyone for HTML, Ruby or Script cards, as this could present a security risk.</em></p>

It's best to do this right when you create your Wagn, because on the cards that you want to be openly editable that exist before you do this, you will have to change the Options one by one. Note: Make sure <strong>not</strong> to give edit permissions to Anyone for HTML, Ruby or Script cards, as this could present a security risk.</em></p>

    <hr>
    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <p><em>To create an Open-edit Wagn, change the permissions in the Options tab of [[Basic+*tform]] so that it is editable and creatable by "Anyone". Do the same for any other [[Cardtypes]] you want people to be able to edit and create without being signed in (i.e. [[Date+*tform]], etc.). It's best to do this right when you create your Wagn, because on the cards that you want to be openly editable that exist before you do this, you will have to change the Options one by one. Note: Make sure <strong>not</strong> to give edit permissions to Anyone for HTML, Ruby or Script cards, as this could present a security risk.</em></p>

    <p>[[*instances+*rform]] is in default, last-edited order. Sort alpha?</p>
    <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;--[[John Abbe]].....Mon Mar 02 08:10:02 -0800 2009</em></p>
    <hr>
    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <h1>Account basics</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are three or four different ways that people can get accounts on your new website:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Invitations</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>By default, people can get accounts only when you or another Administrator invite them. Then </em><em> they receive an email, with their password at the end. Email details:</em></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>{{*invite+*subject|closed}}</p>
    <p>{{*invite+*message|closed}}</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Mediated Sign-up</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>If instead you want people to be able to sign up for an account, but require approval from yourself or another Administrator, then change the [[/card/options/Account Requests|options on Account Requests]] to allow "Anyone" to create Account Requests. (A "Sign Up" link will appear<span> at the top right of every page for people who are not already signed in.) Their requests will be emailed to this address for approval:</span></em></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>{{*request+*to|closed}}</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em><span>People whose requests are approved will receive an invite email as above.</span></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Unmediated Sign-up<br></h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>A third alternative is for people to be able to sign up for an account without requiring any approval. To enable this, change the [[/card/options/Account Requests|options on Account Requests]] to allow "Anyone" to create Account Requests, and, allow "Anyone" to create accounts (on [[/admin/tasks|Global Permissions]]).</em><em> (A "Sign Up" link will appear<span> at the top right of every page for people who are not already signed in.) </span></em><em> People who sign up will almost immediately receive an email, with their new password at the end. Email details:</em></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>{{*signup+*subject|closed}}</p>
    <p>{{*signup+*message|closed}}</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>After Signing Up<br></h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>What people see after signing up should be substantially different depending on whether or not they must wait for approval. You can edit the message here:</em></p>
    <p>{{Signup Success|closed}}</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Open Edit<br></h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>It is also possible to set up your Wagn so that it can generally be edited by people who do not have an account. Currently this takes some time and effort to set up (see Advanced, below), but we're working on making it simpler.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1>Advanced</h1>
    <blockquote>

    <p><strong>[[http://wagn.org/wagn/Google_Analytics|Google Analytics key]]:</strong> {{*google analytics key}}</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Creating a Form for Sign-ups<br></h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>To create a form asking for information from people who are signing up, you will need some understanding of how [[http://wagn.org/formatting|formatting]] works in Wagn. For examples see [[http://wagn.org/wagn/custom_sign-up_information|custom sign-up information]]. Note that the Sign Up link will appear only if you've enabled mediated or unmediated sign-up, as described above.<br></em></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>{{Account Request+*tform|closed}}</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Creating an Open Edit Wagn<br></h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>To create an open edit Wagn, changing the permissions in the Options tab of [[Basic+*tform]] so that it is editable and creatable by Anyone. Do the same for any other [[Cardtypes]] you want people to be able to edit and create without being signed in (i.e. [[Date+*tform]], etc.). It's best to do this right when you create your Wagn, because on the cards that you want to be openly editable that exist before you do this, you will have to change the Options one by one. Note: Make sure <strong>not</strong> to give edit permissions to Anyone for HTML, Ruby or Script cards, as this could present a security risk.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>After Signing Up or Inviting<br></h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>You can change the card that people are taken to after signing up:</em></p>
    <p><strong>(YOUR WAGN'S DOMAIN)/</strong>{{*signup+*thanks}}</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>You can change the card people are taken to after inviting someone:</em></p>
    <p><strong>(YOUR WAGN'S DOMAIN)/</strong>{{*invite+*thanks}}</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>And the message itself:</em></p>
    <p>{{Invite Success|closed}}</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Source of email with account information</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>When someone is invited, or signs up and is approved, they automatically receive their account details via email from the person who invited or approved them. To override the sending email address (or to have new account emails to people who sign up unapproved come from any address at all), edit this:</em></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>There are two main ways for cards to refer to other cards: <strong>links</strong> and <strong>inclusions</strong>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Links (or hyperlinks) are familiar enough to most of us on the web.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Cards that {{_left|name}} links to:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>{{_left+links}}</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Cards that link to {{_left|name}}:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>{{_left+linkers}}</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1>Inclusions</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Inclusions involve nesting a view of a card <em>inside</em> another card.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Cards that {{_left|name}} includes:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>{{_left+inclusions}}</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>To create an open edit Wagn, changing the permissions in the Options tab of [[Basic+*tform]] so that it is editable and creatable by Anyone. Do the same for any other [[Cardtypes]] you want people to be able to edit and create without being signed in (i.e. [[Date+*tform]], etc.). It's best to do this right when you create your Wagn, because on the cards that you want to be openly editable that exist before you do this, you will have to change the Options one by one.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;--[[John Abbe]].....Mon Mar 02 08:10:02 -0800 2009</em></p>
    <hr>
    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>[[*type cards+*rform]] is in default, last-edited order. Sort alpha?</p>
    <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;--[[John Abbe]].....Mon Mar 02 08:10:02 -0800 2009</em></p>
    <hr>
    <p>I did a bunch of work on this today.  My focal points were:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>getting rid of text.  I think we want as little text as possible in this thing, because every line of text is something that could later prove wrong or awkward, and it will be hard to update.  I'd much rather link off to wagn.org (though I would hope that most users could avoid having to use much documentation).</li>
    <li>trimming blank cards where possible.  John and I may want to discuss.  Before we wanted a lot of those blank cards there to have the right default type, but I'm now kind of inclined to take them off and let the default setting handle it.</li>
    <li>I moved a lot of the (much trimmed) signup information into *signup, *request, and *invite.  The paragraphs there seemed like overkill to me.  I'd like to do even less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>I took off the [[All cards]] card (for now) because the wql is rough, the name is confusing, and the use case is very fuzzy to me.<br><br>I'd like to propose removing Script and Ruby cards from the default setup.<br><br>I'm also seriously considering reopening the "redirect" card conversation, which might be really useful for handling the *thanks and *home cards more coherently (they're essentially redirects).<br><br>I left out the success cards for now thinking a good solution for how to include them might come out of the redirect conversation.  If not they'll need to be more accessible from Config.<br><br>I can also see adding a link to documentation about open-edit wagns to the bottom of the Account Basics section on the Config card, but I wouldn't want those instructions inline, since that may be changing in a hurry.</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p><em>There are three or four different ways that people can get accounts on your new website:</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Invitations</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>By default, people can get accounts only when you or another Administrator invite them. Then </em><em> they receive an email, with their password at the end. Email details:</em></p>

    <h2>Mediated Sign-up</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>If instead you want people to be able to sign up for an account, but require approval from yourself or another Administrator, then change the [[/card/options/Account Requests|options on Account Requests]] to allow "Anyone" to create Account Requests. (A "Sign Up" link will appear<span> at the top right of every page for people who are not signed in.) Their requests will be emailed to this address for approval:</span></em></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em><span>People whose requests are approved will receive an invite email as above.</span></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Unmediated Sign-up</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>A third alternative is for people to be able to sign up for an account without requiring any approval. To enable this, change the [[/card/options/Account Requests|options on Account Requests]] to allow "Anyone" to create Account Requests, and, allow "Anyone" to create accounts (on [[/admin/tasks|Global Permissions]]).</em><em> (A "Sign Up" link will appear<span> at the top right of every page for people who are not signed in.) </span></em><em> People who sign up will almost immediately receive an email, with their new password at the end.

    <h2>A form for Sign-ups</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>To create a form asking for information from people who are signing up, you will need some understanding of how [[http://wagn.org/formatting|formatting]] works in Wagn. For examples see [[http://wagn.org/wagn/custom_sign-up_information|custom sign-up information]].

    <h2>Source of email with account information</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>When someone is invited, or signs up and is approved, they automatically receive their account details via email from the person who invited or approved them. To override the sending email address (or to have new account emails to people who sign up unapproved come from any address at all), edit this:</em></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Creating an Open-edit Wagn</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>To create an Open-edit Wagn, change the permissions in the Options tab of [[Basic+*tform]] so that it is editable and creatable by "Anyone". Do the same for any other [[Cardtypes]] you want people to be able to edit and create without being signed in (i.e. [[Date+*tform]], etc.). It's best to do this right when you create your Wagn, because on the cards that you want to be openly editable that exist before you do this, you will have to change the Options one by one. Note: Make sure <strong>not</strong> to give edit permissions to Anyone for HTML, Ruby or Script cards, as this could present a security risk.</em></p>
