  <body class="wagn">
	  <%# FIXME: the body has a css identifier because the wikiwyg editor has a different "body", currently sans identifier.  Kind of a hack, but it means that we can set defaults for wagn pages that are different from defaults for html within a card.  One shallow issue is that 'wagn' should be an id, not a class, but that will break lots of local.css files, so we should be deliberate about changing this. %>
