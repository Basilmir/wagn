  # Using cruise with Wagn:
  #
  # 1. You can override settings in this cruise_config.rb file in [cruise data]/projects/your_project/cruise_config.rb
  # 2. You should set up database.yml content in files that follow this pattern:  config/cruise.[name].database.yml
  # 3. You should set up wagn.rb content in a file named config/cruise.wagn.rb
  # 4. By default the databases are not regenerated from scratch each time you run the integration tests.  
  #    To trigger re-creation, you will need to remove config/wagn.rb
